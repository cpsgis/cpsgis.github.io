<h4>Action Items</h4>
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>Domain name for  https://cpsgis.github.io/
      $25 annual cost to get a specific domain name
      Collaborate with UW listserv website (CPS GIS Listserv)?
      Add info on King County Training page?
      Figure out how to give access to those who want to add content
      <ul>
        <li>Will need to have another meeting to organize content etc</li>
        <li>Decide on a domain name so easier to remember for users ($25 fee)</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Feedback for following suggestion (from Sergio Vazquez, City of Burien):
      “After our last volunteer group meet, I talked to Fernando about how we should go about contacting potential student presenters and staff from UW or any other agencies. I noticed a lot of different people mentioning their contacts and so on during the meeting…I think we should have a central point of contact and some sort of mission statement for outreach.
      This would do two things:
      <ul>
        <li>Avoid spamming the same contacts from different volunteers</li>
        <li>
          Clear and concise understanding of why we are looking for presenters
          Sergio would volunteer to do the above. Also, should we get enough volunteer presenters we could try coupling their presentations to a relative topic each quarter.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      Can include student presentations if there is time?
      Schools that we can reach to: UW Extension program, UW GIS Department, UW Bothell or Tacoma (Daryn B. will look into a project by a GIS conservation team related to preserving local resources), Bellevue College (looks like there is a geography program here)
    </li>
  </ol>
